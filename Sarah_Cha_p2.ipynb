    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular. With your new preprocessor, how much did you reduce the size of the dictionary?\n",

In addition to the\\nchange in title, the revised ETR BOM has been shortened by several pages\\n(eliminating many extraneous \"that\\'s\" and \"of\\'s\"), and many (minor) errors\\nhave been corrected. This release includes a simplified Joseph Smith Story,\\ntestimonies of the three and eight witnesses, and a \"Words-to-Know\"\\nglossary.\\n\\nAs with the previous announcement, readers are reminded that this is a\\nnot-for-profit endeavor. This is a copyrighted work, but people are welcome\\nto make *verbatim* copies for personal use. People can recuperate the\\nactual costs of printing (paper, copy center charges), but may not charge\\nanything for their time in making copies, or in any way realize a profit\\nfrom the use of this book. See the permissions notice in the book itself\\nfor the precise terms.\\n\\nNegotiations are currently underway with a Mormon publisher vis-a-vis the\\nprinting and distribution of bound books. (Sorry, I\\'m out of the wire-bound\\n\"first editions.\") I will make another announcement about the availability\\nof printed copies once everything has been worked out.\\n\\nFTP information: connect via anonymous ftp to carnot.itc.cmu.edu, then \"cd\\npub\" (you won\\'t see anything at all until you do).\\n\\n\"The Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon\" is currently available in postscript and\\nRTF (rich text format). (ASCII, LaTeX, and other versions can be made\\navailable; contact dba@andrew.cmu.edu for details.) You should be able to\\nprint the postscript file on any postscript printer (such as an Apple\\nLaserwriter); let dba know if you have any difficulties. (The postscript in\\nthe last release had problems on some printers; this time it should work\\nbetter.)

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a plot showing accuracy of the re-trained model vs. the vocabulary size you get when pruning unused features by adjusting the C parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.01 (the default is .0001)."
